## Description
A MERN app for searching for books using the Google Books API and saving books of your choice to a saved list.


## User Story

As a user I want to be able to search for books by title and save books I am interested in to a saved list. If I am no longer interested in a book, I can delete it from my list.

This application was created using the MERN stack. The deployed app can be found at :


## Usage

When the user navigates to the app they are presented with a search bar and invitation to search for books by title. Once a search term is entered, the page will display results on the same page. If the user navigates to the 'saved' pag from the navigation, they will be shown their saved books. If they no longer wish to have a book on their saved list, they can delete it using the provided delete button. Clicking the 'view' button will direct the user to the chosen book's webpage on Google Books.
